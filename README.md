# Stage-of-the-Golden-Witch-Episode-2
repo containing the fansubs for the Umineko EP2 Stage Play. Also may add in the code written to help with initial sub building, if I can clean that up for public release.


How to use these fansubs:
These subtitles are synced to the official release of the Stage of the Golden Witch DVD, which you must own in order to use. Use your preferred media player to apply the .ass file on top of the video.
The translations, timing, and editing were done by Meerot (@meerot_ on twitter) and Mushroom (@kin_mushroom on twitter)
Translations were heavily sourced from both the official releases of the Umineko visual novel and manga, sub file was built using custom code as a base, and edited with Subtitle Edit.

This is a nonprofit translation effort of media by 07th Expansion, all rights are reserved by the original copywright holders.
